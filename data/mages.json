			"<p>A Chakravat accepted to teach him. The master was of Indian descent and they weren’t connecting. Moran translated all the teachings to be more in line with his Jewish heritage, “translating” all the Hindu gods to Angels and demons. He worships mostly Azrael (death), Gabriel (messenger, destruction), Apollyon (abyss), and others.</p>",
			"<p>Long ago, Moran Hallel crossed paths with the Setite Abd ar-Rashid Mukhtar. Initially a knowledge exchange, Moran had visions of Gehenna, foreseeing atrocities orchestrated by Abd. Moran chose to sever their collaboration. He lacks the power to destroy Abd but is determined to thwart his ominous destiny. The encounter left a lingering sense of foreboding, pushing Moran further into his pursuit of safeguarding the delicate balance between life and death.</p>",

They eventually married.</p>",
			"<p>Patricia got pregnant but got a miscarriage. Her Avatar told her something strange : that the child might have been lost because Patricia wasn’t connected to reality. Shortly after, Dominik got into an accident and got a concussion. His brain got messed up. Over the following months his mental health degraded steadily. Patricia felt immense guilt, thinking she was responsible for his accident as well for not being “connected enough”. She started learning neurosciences and found a master of Life magick, a Native American shaman. Given that, she has an odd mix of science and Native American medicine as magick tools. She started experimenting on Dominik to stop his degradation. She doesn’t want to turn him into a machine or improve him. Ut she dreams of getting him back to his old state.</p>",
			"<p>She continues to try to get Dominik back to his old self. In the meantime she lets him take credit for her inventions, it makes him so happy.</p>"

He’s now over 80 years old even though he looks 30, so he doesn’t know what would happen if he stopped taking the Blood."
