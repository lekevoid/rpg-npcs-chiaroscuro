The encounter left a lingering sense of foreboding, pushing Moran further into his pursuit of safeguarding the delicate balance between life and death.</p>",

Shortly after, Dominik got into an accident and got a concussion. His brain got messed up. Over the following months his mental health degraded steadily. Patricia felt immense guilt, thinking she was responsible for his accident as well for not being “connected enough”. She started learning neurosciences and found a master of Life magick, a Native American shaman. Given that, she has an odd mix of science and Native American medicine as magick tools. She started experimenting on Dominik to stop his degradation. She doesn't want to turn him into a machine or improve him. Ut she dreams of getting him back to his old state.</p>",
